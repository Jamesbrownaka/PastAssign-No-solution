# PastAssign-No-solution

1. For a1, write a cpp program that determines if the input is an even or an odd value.

2. For a2, complete the main() to use the linkedstack.

3. For a3, complete the implementation of Heap functions. Functions that need to be completed contain the comment "//Complete this."

4. For a4, write a cpp program that inputs two lists of integers L1 and L2, and outputs the largest number that occurs in L1 but does not occur in L2. This cpp program should use a heap implementation.
